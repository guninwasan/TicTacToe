# TicTacToe
Developed TicTacToe Game in C++. This game features a 3x3 board and it can be played locally by 2 players.

The C++ code for this project cannot be published online since this is a part of the university course, however I have added a file named tictactoe_windows.exe, which can be run on your local computer. To run the game on macOS, you will need to download a Windows/Linux Virtual Desktop and follow the Windows/Linux steps.
Please refer to the screenshots below to see how the program works.
